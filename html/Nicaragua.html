				<p> The local beer of Nicaragua is Tonya, Fun fact in Nicaragua the day before and day of elections all sales of alchol is prohibited. The meal you see to the left with a drink cost around 3$ US and I never got close to finishing it all. The food is very affordable and good, lots of fresh seafood and protien. One unique food item I noticed is all the establishments had this vinegar sauce filled with spices and veggies adding tons of flavor. </p>

				<p> All the civillians and towns folk we met were beyond generous, there was a great sense of community. The only negative I found was how some of the police acted given that Nicaragua is and authotarian government the police force are the power and never checked. We got stopped twice and extorted for activities every local in the area does. Where I was staying there was a large surf culture with many people living off the ocean and a large sceen for relaxing beach side at a bar making new friends.  </p>

				<p> The whole country is gorgeous from volcanoes, deep forests, to the ocean its got it all from coast to coast. I stumbled upon a one of the beaches where the filmed a season of Survivor and in all my travels Nicaragua has some of the most picturesque beaches I have encountered. I saw lots of chickens roaming free the usually stray animals and working ones, and all the fish the ocean provides. </p>

				<p> This trip was my first real experience surfing and I could not have asked for a better location. Day in day out in the water till past dark and spending hours in jungles charting my own path. It was a surreal trip, the background of the home page is a picture I took on the volcanoes of Ometepe and too this day the best photo I have taken. From ducking from cops as a taxi driver sped past a check point to Tonya on the beach I would highly reccomend everyone travel to Nicaragua. </p>
