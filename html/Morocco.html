				<p> There is a lot of diverse food in Morocco mostly meat and grains. Alchol is legal but still very taboo and not allowed in public spaces. One very popular item is a "taco" which is like a wrap or panini with lamb as the most common meat. Morocco is the home of couscous and let me tell you I could eat just that for every meal there, it was so fresh and flavorful.  </p>

				<p> The Moroccan people are the most playful I have ever encountered. Just sitting eating dinner you will have 5 different kids run up to joke with you. Placing an order for anything and the man taking it has his hand on your shoulder listening intently. Europe has had a large effect on the culture I was surprised with how liberal the country was for its Muslim background. One unique cultural difference is they have loud speakers in every town that go off twice a day with a prayer for about 15 min. </p>

				<p> At first glance the rocky areas of Morocco are very a kin to the sage brush hills we have in Colorado. The main difference is the mosquite versus sage and the massive sand dunes. I was in awe when I felt the sand at the beaches and in dunes, the finest sand I have felt like all purpose flour. It was also unreal seeing a proper shepard herding well over 50 goats alongside wild camels. I will never forget the scenes of what felt like endless sand falling into the ocean.  </p>

				<p> I went to Morocco while on a grand trip throughout Europe and after I got back to the states the only regret I had was that I didn't spend thw whole time in Morocco. For a developing country it had by far the highest concetration of friendly people, it felt like everyone I met was overjoyed to have a casual conversation. An interesting thing about Morocco that has carried to the present is how there construct their homes. The ourside of all Moroccan houses are nearly identical to hide class seperation so the only way you can tell someones wealth is by being inside their home and sometimes the door its self.  </p>
