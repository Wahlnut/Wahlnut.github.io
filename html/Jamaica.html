			<p> Jamaican food is known all around the world and is a incredible cuisine. We went to Boston Bay known to have the best jerk chicken on the island. Pattis, conch fritters, fish, lobster, they are all seasoned beyond resonable and very affordable no matter where we were it was a given we would have a good meal. The national beer of Jamaica is Red Stripe which has a classic taste and can be found globally. There was fruit growing all around the island you could pick it fresh from the tree.</p>

				<h3> Culture/People </h3>

			<div class = "topic_para" id = "Jamaica_culture_para">
				<p> The most fun culture I have been around, every beach had music blasting and people celebrating. There is a massive hustle culture there from the moment the plane landed to when I left there was someone trying to sell me something, often very agressive. The locals we were able to talk with were fantastic, amazed by the fact we were going from town to town and not staying at a resort. Those that didn't see us as a cash grab were very hosbitable. We went to a art gallery in Kingston Jamaica has done a great job of keeping track of their history and not losing site of who they are.</p>

				<p> Gorgeous beaches on every corner of the island to the Blue mountians in the center every step was a spectical. We saw waterfalls, watering holes, cliffs and waves to surf. I learned about the pennie wallie which is what they called fireflys. There are sections in the mountians that are so wild that people will show up with just salt and live off the land for years without interacting with another human. </p>

				<p> This trip was more of an exibition than a vaction and I would not have had it any other way. This was my first time to a developing country and I was surprised at every turn. Met so many cool people and also learned skills needed for traveling in these areas with lots of pan handling. Wish I had more to say but the whole trip is a blur as we were moving so much and stimulated essitially the whole time. Go to Jamaica and get out of the resorts the island is the filled with the most life of anywhere I have been.  </p>
