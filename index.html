<p>My name is Rowan and this is a little blog of some trips I have been on to developing countries within the last 3 years. I grew up blessed enough to travel out of country a few times, knowing from a young age that I would want to explore all the world has to offer. I made many good friends in Crested Butte that had traveled tons already or wanted to and with the seasonal set up it made it easy to pack up and hunt for cheap flights to anywhere new. The apprecaition I have gained for life has been profound through these experiences. It is easy to forget how much we have in the states especially here in Gunnison whenever I return I am reminded that it is truly one of the most stunning places on earth. The perscpectives and experinces I have gained are worth more than anything to me. I hope some of what I have to say inspires some to travel and helps myself to remeber what I have gained from these adventures! </p>
